            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                PR Code Reviewer is an open-source Chrome extension that helps you review GitHub pull requests using AI. 
                The extension runs entirely in your browser - there are no backend servers involved.

            <h2>Data Handling</h2>
            <p>
                Here's what you need to know about how your data is handled:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No tracking, no analytics, no cookies - the extension doesn't collect any data</li>
                <li>Your OpenAI API key and settings are stored only in your browser's local storage</li>
                <li>When you review a PR, the selected code is sent only to OpenAI's servers for analysis</li>
                <li>Review results are stored temporarily in your browser's local storage and can be cleared anytime</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>OpenAI Integration</h2>
            <p>
                The only external service this extension uses is OpenAI's API for code analysis. When you use the extension:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your selected code is sent to OpenAI for review using your provided API key</li>
                <li>Your API key is stored securely in your browser and is never shared with anyone</li>
                <li>Please review OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> 
                    to understand how they handle your data</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="important-notice">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Do not use this extension with proprietary, sensitive, or confidential code. 
                Any code you select for review will be sent to OpenAI's servers for analysis. If you have sensitive files 
                or code that should not be shared with external services, please exclude them from the review process.
