                PR Code Reviewer is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your code reviews using AI-powered insights. This

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                I do not collect or store any personal data. All operations are performed locally in your browser, and
                any data processed for code analysis is sent directly to OpenAI's API using the API key you provide.
            </p>

            <h2>Use of OpenAI API</h2>
            <p>
                PR Code Reviewer relies on OpenAI APIs to analyze the content of your GitHub pull requests. When you use
                the extension:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your code is transmitted to OpenAI's servers for processing and analysis.</li>
                <li>Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser and is not shared with me or anyone else.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                As the user, you are responsible for ensuring the security and appropriate use of your OpenAI API key.
                Please review OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>
                to understand how they handle your data.

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                I take your security seriously:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your API key and extension settings are stored securely in your browser's local storage.</li>
                    <li>None of your data is transmitted to my servers or shared with any third-party service other than OpenAI.</li>
