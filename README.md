## How It Works

The extension provides a sophisticated three-tier review system for your pull requests:

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Quick, high-level review of code changes
   - Status-based feedback: "Looks Good", "Warning", or "Requires Changes"
   - Focuses on critical issues that could affect functionality or security
   - Provides concise summary of identified concerns

2. **Comprehensive Feedback**:
   - In-depth analysis of code modifications
   - Specific recommendations for improvements
   - Detailed rationale for suggested changes
   - Practical code examples when applicable

3. **Interactive Discussion**:
   - Context-aware conversations about specific files
   - References initial review findings
   - Clarify suggestions and explore alternatives
   - Maintain full code context during discussions

### Review Process

Each review stage is carefully designed to provide increasingly detailed insights:

1. **Code Extraction** (`dataExtractor.js`):
   - Accurately captures current code state from PR diffs
   - Preserves line numbers for precise feedback
   - Focuses on new and modified code while maintaining context
   - Handles both split and unified diff views

2. **Initial Review** (`reviewPrompt.js`):
   - Evaluates code changes within full file context

3. **Detailed Analysis** (`detailedFeedbackPrompt.js`):
   - Builds upon initial assessment
   - Provides actionable improvement suggestions
   - Explains reasoning behind recommendations
   - Includes example implementations where helpful

4. **Interactive Feedback** (`chatPrompt.js`):
   - Enables focused discussions about specific code sections
   - Maintains awareness of previous review feedback
   - Helps clarify complex suggestions
   - Facilitates collaborative problem-solving
